`aioambient` is a Python3, asyncio-driven library that interfaces with both the
REST and Websocket APIs provided by
[Ambient Weather](https://ambientweather.net).

# Installation

```python
pip install aioambient
```

# Python Versions

`aioambient` is currently supported on:

* Python 3.7
* Python 3.8
* Python 3.9

# API and Application Keys

Utilizing `aioambient` requires both an Application Key and an API Key from
Ambient Weather. You can generate both from the Profile page in your
[Ambient Weather Dashboard](https://dashboard.ambientweather.net).

# Usage

## REST API

```python
import asyncio
from datetime import date

from aiohttp import ClientSession

from aioambient import API


async def main() -> None:
    """Create the aiohttp session and run the example."""
    api = API("<YOUR API KEY>", "<YOUR APPLICATION KEY>")

    # Get all devices in an account:
    await api.get_devices()

    # Get all stored readings from a device:
    await api.get_device_details("<DEVICE MAC ADDRESS>")

    # Get all stored readings from a device (starting at a datetime):
    await api.get_device_details(
        "<DEVICE MAC ADDRESS>", end_date=date(2019, 1, 16)
    )


asyncio.run(main())
```

By default, the library creates a new connection to Ambient Weather with each coroutine.
If you are calling a large number of coroutines (or merely want to squeeze out every
second of runtime savings possible), an
[`aiohttp`](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp) `ClientSession` can be used for connection
pooling:

```python
import asyncio
from datetime import date

from aiohttp import ClientSession

from aioambient import API


async def main() -> None:
    """Create the aiohttp session and run the example."""
    async with ClientSession() as session:
        api = API("<YOUR API KEY>", "<YOUR APPLICATION KEY>")

        # Get all devices in an account:
        await api.get_devices()

        # Get all stored readings from a device:
        await api.get_device_details("<DEVICE MAC ADDRESS>")

        # Get all stored readings from a device (starting at a datetime):
        await api.get_device_details(
            "<DEVICE MAC ADDRESS>", end_date=date(2019, 1, 16)
        )


asyncio.run(main())
```

Please be aware of Ambient Weather's
[rate limiting policies](https://ambientweather.docs.apiary.io/#introduction/rate-limiting).

## Websocket API

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import ClientSession

from aioambient import Websocket


async def main() -> None:
    """Create the aiohttp session and run the example."""
    websocket = Websocket("<YOUR API KEY>", "<YOUR APPLICATION KEY>")

    # Note that you can watch multiple API keys at once:
    websocket = Websocket(["<API KEY 1>", "<API KEY 2>"], "<YOUR APPLICATION KEY>")

    # Define a method that should be fired when the websocket client
    # connects:
    def connect_method():
        """Print a simple "hello" message."""
        print("Client has connected to the websocket")

    websocket.on_connect(connect_method)

    # Alternatively, define a coroutine handler:
    async def connect_coroutine():
        """Waits for 3 seconds, then print a simple "hello" message."""
        await asyncio.sleep(3)
        print("Client has connected to the websocket")

    websocket.async_on_connect(connect_coroutine)

    # Define a method that should be run upon subscribing to the Ambient
    # Weather cloud:
    def subscribed_method(data):
        """Print the data received upon subscribing."""
        print(f"Subscription data received: {data}")

    websocket.on_subscribed(subscribed_method)

    # Alternatively, define a coroutine handler:
    async def subscribed_coroutine(data):
        """Waits for 3 seconds, then print the incoming data."""
        await asyncio.sleep(3)
        print(f"Subscription data received: {data}")

    websocket.async_on_subscribed(subscribed_coroutine)

    # Define a method that should be run upon receiving data:
    def data_method(data):
        """Print the data received."""
        print(f"Data received: {data}")

    websocket.on_data(data_method)

    # Alternatively, define a coroutine handler:
    async def data_coroutine(data):
        """Wait for 3 seconds, then print the data received."""
        await asyncio.sleep(3)
        print(f"Data received: {data}")

    websocket.async_on_data(data_coroutine)

    # Define a method that should be run when the websocket client
    # disconnects:
    def disconnect_method(data):
        """Print a simple "goodbye" message."""
        print("Client has disconnected from the websocket")

    websocket.on_disconnect(disconnect_method)

    # Alternatively, define a coroutine handler:
    async def disconnect_coroutine(data):
        """Wait for 3 seconds, then print a simple "goodbye" message."""
        await asyncio.sleep(3)
        print("Client has disconnected from the websocket")

    websocket.async_on_disconnect(disconnect_coroutine)

    # Connect to the websocket:
    await websocket.connect()

    # At any point, disconnect from the websocket:
    await websocket.disconnect()


asyncio.run(main())
```
